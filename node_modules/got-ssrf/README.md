> Protect Got requests from SSRF

### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/hanover-computing/got-ssrf)

## Why does this matter?

SSRF is the evil sibling to CSRF that essentially allows RCE against your backends: https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf.

This module automatically rejects all such requests so you can safely use got without even thinking about it.

## Install

```sh
npm i got-ssrf
```

## Usage

> Note that this package is ESM-only; see https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c for what to do if you're using CJS (i.e. `require()`).

```js
import { gotSsrf } from 'got-ssrf'

await gotSsrf(url) // automatically filters requests for safety
```

If you have any other plugins you want to "mix" got-ssrf with, see https://github.com/sindresorhus/got/blob/main/documentation/examples/advanced-creation.js for how to do so. Example:

```js
import got from 'got'
import { gotSsrf } from 'got-ssrf'
import { gotInstance } from 'some-other-got-plugin'

const merged = got.extend(gotSsrf, gotInstance)
```

### Security

This library is tested against a whole host of weird edge cases (a URL is not as straightforward as it seems). To see what behaviours are expected, please see the test suite.

As this library doesn't parse the URLs itself (but rather relies on got, which relies on the node `URL` module), a good rule of thumb is that whatever you'd expect from the node `URL` module, you can expect of this library as well.

If you want to disallow "weird" URLs (and trust me, there are _many_), as people may try to 'smuggle' hostnames in them (and cause SSRF that may not be caught by the `URL` module), you'll need to do an input validation of the URL (and reject the "weird" ones) _before_ passing it into got/got-ssrf.

## Run tests

```sh
npm test
```
